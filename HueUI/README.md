# HueUI

**HueUI** is a UI theming and rapid prototyping addon for [**NightBlade MMO**](https://github.com/Fallen-Entertainment/NightBlade_MMO). It allows you to completely restyle your game user interface using theme files, dramatically speeding up UI iteration and enabling easy modification of your theme in the future.

## Features

- **Theme Manager**  
  - Apply an entire HueUITheme to your project with one click

- **13 Core UI Components** (primitives for fast composition)  
  - Basic: Button, Text, Title  
  - Layout: Panel, Panel Group, Grid Container, List Container  
  - Structural: Container, Divider, Menubar, Scrollbar
  - Game-specific: ItemTitle, SelectedItem

- **Customizable Component Editors**  
  - Edit component settings (Primary/Default button style or Left/Center/Right Panel position for example)  
  - Per-component overrides
  - Visual preview in editor

- **Extensive Theme Properties** (80+)  
  Colors, fonts, paddings, borders... perfect for deep customization or commercial theme packs

- **Built-in Prototyping Assets**  
  - Fantasy-style backgrounds and decorative dividers
  - Ready-to-use texture atlases

- **Prefabs**  
  Pre-configured combinations of HueUI + NightBlade components  
  (currently focused on **Home scene** – more coming)


## Why HueUI?

| Goal                          | Without HueUI                          | With HueUI                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Change game art style         | Manual sprite replacement everywhere   | Swap 1 theme file                            |
| Sell custom UI themes         | Very hard / per-component work         | Theme file = complete style package          |
| Prototype new interface       | Slow, lots of duplicated work          | Fast composition with primitives + prefabs   |
| Consistent look across menus  | Easy to miss elements                  | Everything inherits from central theme       |


## Roadmap

- [ ] Make more NightBlade built-in UI elements HueUI-compatible (Inventory, Skillbar, etc.)
- [ ] Additional UI components
- [ ] Component animations
